Additionally, these products often come in various concentrations, enabling users to adjust their dosage based on individual requirements. This flexibility has driven the growth of the CBD oil segment, as consumers seek personalized solutions for their sleep-related issues. The increasing awareness of the potential benefits of CBD in managing sleep disorders has further fueled the demand for these products.</p><p>Another key application segment in the CBD products for sleep market is the category of edibles and capsules.
